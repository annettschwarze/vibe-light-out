# Vibe Coding Game Experiment

The project served as a test how well a small game can be implemented using vibe coding.
The goal was to create a "light-out puzzle" game using HTML and JavaScript. 
The inspiration came from a mini game called "Mezzonic Protolock" https://www.wowhead.com/quest=65461/your-first-mezzonic-protolock.
